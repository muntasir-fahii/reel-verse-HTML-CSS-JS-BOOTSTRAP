            <h3>Top Gun: Maverick</h3>
            <p>
              <strong>Top Gun: Maverick</strong> is a 2022 American action drama
              film directed by Joseph Kosinski. It is the sequel to the 1986
              film Top Gun and the second installment in the Top Gun film
              series. Written by Ehren Kruger, Eric Warren Singer, and
              Christopher McQuarrie, the film is based on a story by Peter Craig
              and Justin Marks. It stars Tom Cruise and Val Kilmer reprising
              their roles from the original film, alongside Miles Teller,
              Jennifer Connelly, Jon Hamm, Glen Powell, Lewis Pullman, and Ed
              Harris. In the film, Maverick confronts his past while training a
              group of younger Top Gun graduates, including the son of his
              deceased best friend, for a dangerous mission. Development of a
              Top Gun sequel was announced in 2010 by Paramount Pictures.
              Cruise, along with producer Jerry Bruckheimer and director Tony
              Scott, were asked to return. Craig wrote a draft of the screenplay
              in 2012, but the project stalled when Scott died later that
              year.[5] The film was later dedicated to Scott's memory.[6]
              Production resumed in 2017 after Kosinski was hired to direct.
              Principal photography, which involved the use of IMAX-certified 6K
              full-frame cameras, took place from May 2018 to April 2019 in
              California, Washington, and Maryland. An initial release date was
              scheduled for July 12, 2019, but it was delayed several times due
              to the complex action sequences and the COVID-19 pandemic. During
              the pandemic, several streaming companies attempted to buy the
              streaming rights to the film from Paramount but all offers were
              declined on the orders of Cruise, who insisted the film be
              released exclusively in cinemas.[7] Top Gun: Maverick premiered at
              CinemaCon on April 28, 2022, and was theatrically released by
              Paramount Pictures in the United States on May 27, 2022, in IMAX,
              4DX,[8] ScreenX,[9] and Dolby Cinema.[10] The film was widely
              praised by critics, with many deeming it superior to its
              predecessor.[11] It has grossed over $1.4 billion worldwide,
              becoming the highest-grossing film of 2022, the second film
              released during the COVID-19 pandemic to gross $1 billion and the
              highest-grossing film of Cruise's filmography.After more than
              thirty years of service as one of the Navy's top aviators, Pete
              Mitchell is where he belongs, pushing the envelope as a courageous
              test pilot.
